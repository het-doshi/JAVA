/*

Encapsulation → Bundles data (fields) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class)
and restricts direct access to the data using access modifiers.
Access is controlled through getters and setters.
→ Think "data hiding + controlled access".

Abstraction → Shows only the essential details and hides the internal implementation.
Achieved via abstract classes or interfaces.
→ Think "implementation hiding".
