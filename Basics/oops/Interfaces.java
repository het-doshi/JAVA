/*

 interface --> where you need to work with a variety of classes but want to treat them uniformly. 
 
 -> An interface acts as a contract because it defines a set of methods that must be implemented by any 
    class that implements the interface.
    
 -> This ensures consistency across different classes, as all implementing classes are guaranteed to have 
    the methods declared in the interface.

 -> by default methods are public and abstract, variable are static & final 

 Notes on Interface Variables in Java -> means when refrence type of variable is interface 
  
 -> You can declare an interface type variable inside any class, even if that class does not implement 
    the interface.
 
 -> Declaring interfacename refrence variable; 
    means refrence variable can hold a reference to any object of a class that implements interface

 -> implementing classes means classes who implements the interface

 -> the constructor of the implementing class is called when you do new implementingclassesName().

 -> you can create objects of implementing classes and assign them
